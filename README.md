# NgrxFire

This is a simple voting application using Angular 8 and redux via ngrx to manage the state. This repo will be a good reference to simply implement ngrx in future angular apps. View the demo site with the console open or use the Redux Devtools chrome extension which can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwpuXpBRAAEiwAyRRPgcrTRpSn1JhK6PX42eqWan_wZW1Xzm0K8foJuPeukNOa_FNvcqaPHBoC970QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
